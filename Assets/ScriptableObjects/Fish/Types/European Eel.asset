  bio: "The snake of the lake, the long a slippery European eel. However this is
    not a snake it is a fish or rather a sub species of fish. This eel grows up to
    40 to 60 cm long and lives amongst the mud in the south parts of the lake as
    it does not thrive in the cold up north. There is one eel\u2026 they call him
    the grandfather he has been in the waters for 144 years, would be a good catch."
