  bio: 'The Arctic Cisco is one of the most common fish in the northern parts of
    the lake. The large silver scaled body can reach 50 cm in length and weight up
    to 2 kg making it a study meal for any family. It being a common fish it will
    probably not give you a high price on the market, but it will give you a reliable
    income for sure. '
