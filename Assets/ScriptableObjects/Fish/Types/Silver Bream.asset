  bio: 'Also known as Silver Bream the Blicca Bjoerkna can grow to weigh 1.3 kg and
    be up to 40 cm long. It is found in the Northern parts of Noguur and is quite
    unique as when it is young it will have more of a bronze colour to its scales
    but no less beautiful. However upon reaching maturity it will become pure silver
    in colour. What a treat. '
